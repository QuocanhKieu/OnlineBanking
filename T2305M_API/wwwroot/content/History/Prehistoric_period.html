    While the true original inhabitants of Vietnam were the Hoabinhians, they had of
    course been replaced and absorbed by the East Eurasian-looking populace and the
    expansion of preliminary Austroasiatic and Austronesian languages, although
    linguistic data are not totally interrelated with genetic. Later on, that trend
    continued with the expansion of Tibeto-Burman and Kra-Dai speaking population, and
    the more recent Hmong-Mien speaking communities. All modern ethnic groups of Vietnam
    thus possess various ratios of genetic admixture between the Eastern Eurasian and
    Hoabinhian groups.<sup id="cite_ref-Liu2020_8-3" class="reference">

    Situated on the southeast edge of monsoon Asia, much of ancient Vietnam enjoyed a
    combination of high rainfall, humidity, heat, favorable winds, and fertile soil.
    These natural sources combined to generate an unusually prolific growth of rice and
    other plants and wildlife. This region's agricultural villages held well over 90
    percent of the population. The high volume of rainy season water required villagers
    to concentrate their labor in managing floods, transplanting rice, and harvesting.
    These activities produced a cohesive village life with a religion in which one of
    the core values was the desire to live in harmony with nature and with other people.
    The way of life, centered in harmony, featured many enjoyable aspects that the
    people held beloved, typified by not needing many material things, the enjoyment of
    music and poetry, and living in harmony with nature.<sup id="cite_ref-13"

    </sup> Pottery reached a higher
    level of technique and decoration style. The early farming multilinguistic societies
    in Vietnam were mainly wet rice <span href="Oryza.html" title="Oryza">Oryza</span>
    cultivators, which became the main staple of their diet. During the later stage of
    the first half of the 2nd millennium BC, the first appearance of bronze tools took
    place despite these tools still being rare. By about 1000 BC, bronze replaced stone
    for about 40 percent of edged tools and weapons, rising to about 60 percent. Here,
    there were not only bronze weapons, axes, and personal ornaments, but also sickles
    and other agriculture tools. Toward the closure of the Bronze Age, bronze accounts
    for more than 90 percent of tools and weapons, and there are exceptionally
    extravagant graves – the burial places of powerful chieftains – containing some
    hundreds of ritual and personal bronze artifacts, such as musical instruments,
    bucket-shaped ladles, and ornament daggers. After 1000 BC, the ancient peoples of
    Vietnam became skilled agriculturalists as they grew rice and kept buffaloes and
    pigs. They were also skilled fishermen and bold sailors, whose long dug-out canoes
    traversed the eastern sea.
