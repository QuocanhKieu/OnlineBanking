        The diet of <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Ancient_Japan/">
            ancient
            Japan
        </span> was heavily influenced by its geography as an archipelago,
        foodstuffs and eating habits imported from mainland Asia, religious beliefs, and
        an appreciation for the aesthetic appearance of dishes, not just the taste.
        Millet was replaced by rice as the main staple food from c. 300 BCE and seafood
        was preferred to meat, both for its abundance and because <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/buddhism/">Buddhism</span>, introduced in
        the 6th century CE, largely prohibited the killing of animals and birds. A wide
        variety of fruit and vegetables were available while tea and <em>sake </em>were
        the popular drinks, at least for the aristocracy.

    <h3>Geography &amp; Weather</h3>
    <p>
        The geography of <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/Japan/">Japan</span> is
        varied and so, therefore, is each region's capacity for <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/Agriculture/">agriculture</span>.
        The Inland Sea basin between Honshu and Shikoku benefits from heavy rains during
        the growing season and sunny, dry days of subtropical temperatures prior to
        harvest, while late Autumn rains coming in with the Pacific Ocean winds and mild
        winters help winter crops. Delayed rains or early typhoons can destroy crops. In
        contrast, the north-west of Honshu receives icy winds and snow sweeping in from
        Asia.
    </p>

    <h3><span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/mythology/">Mythology</span></h3>
    <p>
        Given the fickle whims of Nature and the real possibility of devastating weather
        phenomena which could wipe out crops, it is not surprising that the ancient
        Japanese conjured up deities to protect their interests.

        Agriculture (nogaku) in ancient Japan, as it remains today,
        was largely focussed on cereal &amp; vegetable production.
    </div>
    <p>
        Food (<em>shokumotsu</em>) could have its own gods. There was a general and
        ancient food goddess from Ise, and <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Inari/">Inari</span> was established as the
        national rice <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/God/">god</span> long after
        local rice gods had already been protecting farmers and promising them a good
        harvest when they received suitable offerings. Even rice fields had their own
        protective <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Shinto/">Shinto</span> spirit,
        <em>ta no <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Kami/">kami</span></em>. An
        important part of agriculture were religious ceremonies and rituals, especially
        around sowing and harvest time, which were meant to ensure a good crop and
        protect it from disasters. Ceremonies involving rice were particularly important
        and involved the emperor. Famine, too, was represented in mythology as an old
        crone who had set fish traps to deprive the people of salmon but who was
        eventually killed by the hero Okikurmi. Buddhism also featured food-related
        figures, notably Iorin, a manifestation of Kannon, who is the patroness of
        fishermen, and Ida-ten, the god of the meal in Zen sects. The latter is prayed
        to before meals and watches for any excess of appetite.
    </p>
    <h3>Agriculture</h3>
    <p>
        Agriculture (<em>nogaku</em>) in ancient Japan, as it remains today, was largely
        focussed on cereal and vegetable production, with meat only being produced in
        relatively limited quantities. Early food sources during the <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Jomon_Period/">Jomon Period</span> (c.
        14,500 - c. 300 BCE or earlier) were millet and edible grasses. The first traces
        of crop cultivation date to c. 5700 BCE with slash-and-burn agriculture. Farming
        of specific and repeated areas of land occurred from c. 4,000 BCE.
    </p>
    <p>
        By far the most important staple food was rice. There is evidence of rice c. 1250
        BCE, introduced to Japan via migrants from mainland Asia in the late Jomon
        Period, but its cultivation was likely not until c. 800 BCE. The first evidence
        of growing rice in wet fields dates to c. 600 BCE when the technique was
        introduced, again by migrants from Asia, during the transition from the Jomon to
        the <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Yayoi_Period/">Yayoi Period</span>. The
        earliest paddy fields appeared in the south-west and then spread northwards. <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Yayoi_Period/">Yayoi</span> immigrants also
        brought azuki beans, soybeans, wheat, and, from <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/china/">China</span>, what has become the
        Japanese dish <em>par excellence</em>, sushi.

    <p>
        Agricultural was slow to develop, and it was not until the introduction of iron
        tools and techniques from <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Korea/">Korea</span> in the <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Kofun_Period/">Kofun Period</span> (c. 250 -
        538 CE) that progress was made in efficiency. Even during the <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Nara_Period/">Nara Period</span> (710-794
        CE) agriculture still depended on primitive tools, not enough land was prepared
        for crops, and irrigation techniques were insufficient to prevent frequent crop
        failures and outbreaks of famine (notably in 730 CE and c. 1180 CE). There was
        some state support in the form of loans of seed-rice in the 9th century CE, but
        the interest rates were between 30 and 50%. Only the <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Kamakura_Period/">Kamakura Period</span>
        (1183-1333 CE) and medieval times would see such techniques as double-cropping,
        better seed strains and a wider use of fertiliser.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given this unreliability, most small farmers preferred the greater security of
        working for landed aristocrats on their large estates (<em>shoen</em>). Only
        these estates were properly irrigated, and small independent farmers had to do
        with rainfall or natural underground sources, and so settle for dry field crops
        like millet (and hemp) as well as barley, wheat, and buckwheat. Rice, when grown
        in such conditions, was reserved to pay taxes. Other crops included barley and
        mulberry, the latter needed for the production of <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Silk/">silk</span>.
    </p>
    <h3>Diet </h3>
    <p>
        As Japan is a collection of variously sized islands, seafood was easily acquired
        and was much more popular than meat, <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Animal_Husbandry/">animal husbandry</span>
        being a more costly and time-consuming source of food. Examples of seafood eaten
        are shellfish, seaweed, sea cucumber, bonito, bream, sea bass, eel, carp,
        mackerel, sardine, salmon, trout, shark, prawns, squid, jellyfish, and crab.
        Fish, if not eaten fresh and on site, was transported inland dried.

        When Buddhism was introduced into Japan in the 6th century CE and then officially
        adopted and sponsored by the state, the <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/religion/">religion</span>, with its
        avoidance of killing animals and birds, provided another reason for seafood and
        vegetables to dominate the Japanese diet. Buddhism did not prohibit the eating
        of all types of meat, with wild boar and venison being exceptions to the rule.
        Pheasant was another meat which maintained its popularity. It is also true that
        some <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/buddhism/">Buddhist</span> sects were
        stricter and required their followers to eat a vegetarian diet.

            by Kakinomoto Hitomaro on Natures bounty for Empress Jito (Ebrey, 150).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The best-known period regarding Japanese diet is the <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Heian_Period/">Heian Period</span> (794-1185
        CE) when <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/literature/">literature</span>
        flourished and references to eating practices can be found amongst the court
        intrigues and romantic interludes. Our knowledge is largely restricted to that
        of the aristocracy as they were the ones who wrote the literature and they
        concentrated on their own lavish dinner parties held in their pleasure palaces
        of the capital <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Heiankyo/">Heiankyo</span>
        (Kyoto). We can imagine that the diet of the ordinary population was much less
        palatable, although it might have been healthier as many a noble court writer
        alludes to the boils and other maladies related to malnutrition which plagued
        the imperial court.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aristocrats had two meals a day - one at around 10 am and the second at 4 am but,
        again, we can imagine that labourers and farmers probably ate early and late in
        the day so as not to interfere with their work. People would have eaten snacks,
        too, of fruit, nuts, or rice cakes, for example.
    </p>
    <div class="big_quote">
        Food was seasoned using salt, ginger, mint, garlic, vinegar,
        &amp; fish broth.
    </div>
    <p>
        Rice, the staple, was boiled, steamed, or cooked and then dried. It was mixed
        with vegetables to make rice cakes or made into a thick porridge and spiced up
        with vegetables or other cereals. Popular vegetables included the versatile
        soybean which could be made into a flavouring paste (<em>miso</em>),
        <em>tofu</em> (bean curd), or soy sauce. There were red beans, Japanese sweet
        potatoes, bamboo shoots, aubergines, cucumbers, burdock, onions, spring onions,
        yams, and radishes. They were eaten raw or boiled, steamed or pickled. Food was
        seasoned using salt, ginger, mint, garlic, vinegar, and fish broth. A sweeter
        taste was achieved by adding honey, a rice jelly, or a liquid known as
        <em>amazura</em><em> </em>which was pressed from wild grapes. Another way to add
        extra taste was cooking using walnut or sesame oil.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fruit available included peaches, the Japanese orange, tangerines, persimmons,
        loquats, plums, pomegranates, apples, raspberries, and strawberries. There were
        also nuts such as chestnuts, walnuts, and pine nuts. Fats were provided
        (probably in insufficient quantities) by eggs, milk and butter products.
    </p>
    <p>
        Such quintessential Japanese dishes as <em>tempura </em>and <em>sukiyaki</em>
        were introduced to the islands much later - <em>tempura</em> via the Portuguese
        in the 16th century CE and <em>sukiyaki</em> in the early 20th century CE after
        beef was made fashionable there by western Europeans.

        Tea (<em>cha</em>) was another popular introduction from China (6th-7th century
        CE), and according to tradition it first grew from a bush which grew from the
        discarded eyelids of the sage Daruma (aka Boddhidarma), the founder of Zen
        Buddhism. Also from China came better tea plants and the elaborate ceremony
        involved in its preparation (<em>chanoyu</em>). Tea drinking was first adopted
        by Zen Buddhist monks as it was thought to aid meditation and ward off sleep.
        The drink was also considered to have medicinal qualities. The tea was prepared
        by pounding the leaves and making a ball with <em>amazura</em> or ginger, which
        was then left to brew in hot water. Eventually, from 1200 CE, specialised tea
        schools were opened, people drank in dedicated tea rooms (<em>chashitsu</em>),
        and people's finest porcelain was reserved for tea drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally, one important drink which, again, remains a quintessential symbol of
        Japan is <em>sake </em>or rice wine. In mythology, the drink comes from Tokyo, a
        gift from Sukunabikona, the god of magic and healing. <em>Sake</em> was and is a
        common offering to the gods of Shinto shrines. Finally, illustrating the
        antiquity of <em>sake</em> and its importance in Japanese <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/culture/">culture</span>,
        Otomo no Tabito (665-731) famously composed 13 poems praising the drink, and
        here is one of them:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Instead of fretting</p>
        <p>Over things of no avail,</p>
        <p>It would seem better</p>
        <p>To drink a cupful</p>
        <p>Of clouded sake. </p>
        <p>(Keene, 137)</p>
