                        At the turn of the century, reaction against the industrial age and a need for honesty and
                        simplicity in design led the proponents of the Arts and Crafts movement to embrace a style of
                        simple comfort and grace, influenced by the colors and materials of the earth. We will trace the
                        development of the Arts and Crafts movement in England as it was shepherded by William Morris
                        and his followers, as they rekindled enthusiasm for beauty, harmony, and craftsmanship in
                        architecture and hand-crafted decorative objects.
