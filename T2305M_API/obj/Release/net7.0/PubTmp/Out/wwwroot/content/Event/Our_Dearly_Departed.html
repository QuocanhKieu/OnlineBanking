                Mourning jewelry in Western European (and later, American) culture dates back to the 16th century but
                gained huge popularity in the mid-19th century when Queen Victoria mourned the death of her beloved
                Prince Albert. A few years later, America was embroiled in a civil war with massive loss of life, also
                creating a big demand for items of mourning.<br><br>In this talk, Sarah Nehama, a metalsmith and antique
                jewelry collector, will give an overview history of mourning jewelry, beginning with the source of its
                early iconography in memento mori jewelry and objects. She will cover style, iconography, and materials
                from the mid-17th century up to the early 20th century, showing mourning jewelry’s place in connection
                to political and public figures, as well as intimate friends and family. Its relation to sentimental
                jewelry through this time period, particularly sentimental pieces incorporating hair, portraits, or
                photos, will also be covered. Sarah will have many visual examples to share, and she will highlight
                jewelry with specific New England connections.

                Sarah Nehama is a working metalsmith and antique jewelry collector based in Providence, RI. Sarah
                received a degree in Art History from Boston University and studied jewelry making at the century-old
                North Bennett Street School in Boston's North End. She also learned the ancient technique of high-karat
                gold granulation with Cecilia Bauer in her New York City studio. In 2012, Sarah co-curated the
                exhibition, <em><em>In Death Lamented: The Tradition of Anglo-American Mourning Jewelry </em></em>at the
                Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston, MA. She authored the companion volume by the same name and
                was a major lender to the exhibition. Since then, Sarah has lectured on the topic of mourning and
                sentimental jewelry at museums, historical societies, jewelry associations, and antique symposia, both
                in the U.S. and in Australia.
