                Please join us via Zoom on Wednesday, September 18, 2024, 7-9 pm EDT (UTC-4) for Let's Talk Series: The
                White Power Movement: Its History, Threat and What You Can Do About It.
            </p>
            <p>
                The white power movement has long posed a threat to our safety and to our democracy. In this session,
                Julie Farnam will discuss the origins of the white power movement in the United States, how it has
                inspired violence throughout the years, where the movement stands today, and what we can do to address
                its danger. She will examine the continued assault on our educational system to deny children the right
                to know and understand different perspectives and that prevent the healing of past wrongs as well as
                strategies to recognize and combat hate in our communities.

                Julie Farnam served as the Assistant and then Acting Director of Intelligence for the United States
                Capitol Police during one of the most tumultuous periods in this country’s history. During her time
                there, she oversaw the identification and vetting of nearly 20,000 threats against members of Congress,
                many of which were made by U.S. citizens who adhered to extremist ideologies. Prior to joining the
                Capitol Police, Farnam served with the Department of Homeland Security for over fifteen years.
