                        "Musicals are, by nature, theatrical, meaning poetic, meaning having to move the
                        audience’s imagination and create a suspension of disbelief, by which I mean there’s no fourth
                        wall." -Stephen Sondheim

                From its accidental beginnings to the modern phenomenon which is <em><em>Hamilton</em></em>, musicals as
                an art form have dominated the performance landscape for over 150 years. How did this dynamic,
                innovative, and theatrical art form develop over the generations, and what were the major game changers
                that brought it to new heights? It's time to uncover the unforgettable performances and productions that
                gave musical theater a universal appeal transcending cultural boundaries.
