	<p>During the Tang dynasty, Vietnam was called <span href="Annam_(Chinese_province).html" class="mw-redirect"
			title="Annam (Chinese province)">Annam</span> until AD 866.
		With its capital around modern <span href="B%e1%ba%afc_Ninh_Province.html" class="mw-redirect"
			title="Bắc Ninh Province">Bắc Ninh</span>, Annam became a
		flourishing trading outpost, receiving goods from the southern seas. The <i><span
				href="Book_of_the_Later_Han.html" title="Book of the Later Han">Book of the
				Later Han</span></i> recorded that in 166 the first envoy from the <span href="Roman_Empire.html"
			title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</span> to China arrived
		by this route, and merchants were soon to follow. The 3rd-century <i>Tales of
			Wei</i> (<i><span href="Weil%c3%bce.html" title="Weilüe">Weilüe</span></i>) mentioned
		a "water route" (the Red River) from Annam into what is now southern <span href="Yunnan.html"
			title="Yunnan">Yunnan</span>. From there, goods were taken over
		land to the rest of China via the regions of modern <span href="Kunming.html" title="Kunming">Kunming</span> and
		<span href="Chengdu.html" title="Chengdu">Chengdu</span>. The capital of Annam, Tống Bình or <span
			href="Songping.html" title="Songping">Songping</span> (today Hanoi) was a major
		urbanized settlement in the southwest region of Tang Empire. From 858 to 864,
		disturbances in Annan gave <span href="Nanzhao.html" title="Nanzhao">Nanzhao</span>, a
		Yunnan kingdom, opportunity to intervene the region, provoking local tribes to
		revolt against the Chinese. The Yunnanese and their local allies launched the <span
			href="Siege_of_Songping.html" title="Siege of Songping">Siege of Songping</span> in
		early 863, defeating the Chinese, and captured the capital in three years. In 866,
		Chinese jiedushi <span href="Gao_Pian.html" title="Gao Pian">Gao Pian</span> recaptured
		the city and drove out the Nanzhao army. He renamed the city to Daluocheng (大羅城, <span
			href="%c4%90%e1%ba%a1i_La.html" title="Đại La">Đại La</span> thành).
	</p>
	<p>In 866, Annan was renamed <span href="T%c4%a9nh_H%e1%ba%a3i_qu%c3%a2n.html" title="Tĩnh Hải quân">Tĩnh Hải
			quân</span>. Early in the 10th century, as China
		became politically fragmented, successive lords from the <span href="Kh%c3%bac_clan.html" title="Khúc clan">Khúc
