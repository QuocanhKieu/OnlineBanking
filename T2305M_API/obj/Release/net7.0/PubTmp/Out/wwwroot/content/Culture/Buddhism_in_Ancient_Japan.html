    <p>
        <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/buddhism/">Buddhism</span> was introduced to
        <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Ancient_Japan/">ancient Japan</span> via <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Korea/">Korea</span> in the 6th century CE
        with various sects following in subsequent centuries via <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/china/">China</span>. It was readily
        accepted by both the elite and ordinary populace because it confirmed the
        political and economic status quo, offered a welcoming reassurance to the
        mystery of the afterlife, and complemented existing <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Shinto/">Shinto</span>
        beliefs. <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/buddhism/">Buddhist</span> monasteries were
        established across the country, and they became powerful political players in
        their own right. Buddhism was also a key driver in fostering literacy, education
        in general, and the arts in ancient <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/Japan/">Japan</span>.

    <h3>Introduction to Japan</h3>
    <p>
        Buddhism was introduced into Japan in either 538 CE or 552 CE (traditional date)
        from the Korean kingdom of <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Baekje/">Baekje</span> (<span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Baekje/">Paekche</span>). It was adopted by
        the Soga clan particularly, which had Korean roots and was practised by the
        significant Korean immigrant population in Japan at that time. Buddhism received
        official government support in 587 CE during the reign of Emperor Yomei (585-587
        CE), even if some aristocratic clan groups (the Monobe and Nakatomi especially)
        opposed it and still adhered to purely Shinto beliefs. Buddhism reinforced the
        idea of a layered society with different levels of social status with the
        emperor very much at the top and protected by the Four Guardian Kings of
        Buddhist <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/law/">law</span>. The
        aristocracy could also handily claim that they enjoyed their privileged position
        in society because they had accumulated merit in a previous life.
    </p>
    <div class="big_quote">
        Once officially adopted, monks, scholars &amp; students were
        regularly sent to China to learn the tenets of Buddhism in more depth.
    </div>
    <p>
        In addition to the reinforcement, Buddhism gave to the status quo; the adoption
        of Buddhism, it was hoped, would be looked on favourably by the more advanced
        neighbouring cultures of Korea and China and enhance Japan's reputation as a
        rising civilised nation in East Asia. Once officially adopted, monks, scholars,
        and students were regularly sent to China to learn the tenets of Buddhism in
        more depth and bring back that knowledge, along with art and even sometimes
        relics, for the benefit of the Japanese people.
    </p>
    <h3>
        <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Prince_Shotoku/">Prince Shotoku</span> &amp;
        the Spread of Buddhism
    </h3>
    <p>
        The man credited with really putting Buddhism at the forefront of Japanese
        religious practices is Prince Shotoku (574-622 CE), who ruled Japan as regent
        from 594 CE until his <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/Death/">death</span>. Shotoku
        famously drew up a new constitution (or, perhaps more accurately, an ethical
        code) in 604 CE called the <em>
            Seventeen Article Constitution
        </em>(<em>Jushichijo-</em><em>kenpo</em>). The points made therein attempted to
        justify the centralisation of government and emphasised both Buddhist and
        Confucian principles, especially the importance of harmony (<em>wa</em>).
        Shotoku particularly emphasised the reverence of Buddhism, as seen in Article II
        of his constitution:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Sincerely reverence the three treasures. The three treasures, <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Siddhartha_Gautama/">Buddha</span>, the
            Law and the Priesthood, are the final refuge of the four generated beings,
            and are the supreme objects of faith in all countries. What man in what age
            can fail to reverence this law? Few men are utterly bad. They may be taught
            to follow it. But if they do not betake them to the three treasures, how
            shall their crookedness be made straight? (Henshall, 499)
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        True to his own declaration, Shotoku built many temples and monasteries, formed a
        body of artists to create Buddhist images, and he was himself a student of its
        teachings, <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/writing/">writing</span>
        commentaries on three sutras. During his reign, Shotoku built 46 Buddhist
        monasteries and temples, the most important of which were the Shitennoji, Hokoji
        (596 CE), and <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Horyuji/">Horyuji</span>.

    <p></p>
    <h3>Imperial Favour</h3>
    <p>
        The spread continued with the full support of Emperor Temmu (r. 672-686 CE) and
        Empress Jito (r. 686-697 CE) who built yet more temples, had more copies of
        sutras made, and who used monasteries as depots for official population and tax
        records. Emperor Shomu (r. 724-749 CE) was even more ambitious and set out to
        build a <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/temple/">temple</span> in every
        province, each with its own seven-storied pagoda, a plan that raised taxation to
        brutal levels. Major temples were built at the then capital <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Nara/">Nara</span>, too, such as <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Todaiji/">Todaiji</span>, finally completed
        in 752 CE in a project supervised by the celebrated monk Gyogi (668-749 CE).
        Emperor Shomu was also important as he began the strategy of an emperor
        abdicating in favour of his chosen successor and then joining a monastery but
        still pulling political strings behind the latticed screens in what became known
        as 'cloistered government'.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the same time as endorsing Buddhism, the Japanese elite was also wary of its
        powers and particularly concerned that a charismatic individual might abuse the
        reverence of the populace and form a following which could threaten the
        political stability of the state. For this reason, a body of laws was passed in
        the 8th century CE (the <em>Taiho </em><em>ritsuryo</em> in 702 CE and
        <em>Yoro</em><em> </em><em>ritsuryo</em> in 757 CE) which forbade monks to have
        private chapels, practise divination, make any attempt to actively convert
        believers of one faith to another, and use magic to cure illness. Neither could
        monks or nuns accept gifts of slaves, cattle, or weapons, own land, buildings or
        valuables in their own name, <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/trade/">trade</span>, collect
        interest on loans, or even become a monk after the required period of study
        without official permission.
    </p>
    <div class="big_quote">
        Buddhist monks could not make any attempt to actively convert
        believers of one faith to another or use magic to cure illness.
    </div>
    <p>
        In another precaution, Buddhist monasteries and monks were carefully monitored
        and their actions subject to the laws which applied to all citizens, even if
        their punishments were usually a little more lenient. These measures did not
        actually achieve their aim as there are many instances of monks and temples
        abusing their position, illegally acquiring land, committing fraud, practising
        exorbitant usury (which often rendered the peasantry unable to pay their taxes),
        and making a healthy living as pawnbrokers charging 180% per annum.
    </p>
    <h3>Co-existence with Shinto</h3>
    <p>
        The indigenous beliefs of the ancient Japanese included animism and Shinto and
        neither were particularly challenged by the arrival of Buddhism. Shinto,
        especially, with its emphasis on the here and now and this life, left a
        significant gap regarding what happens after death and here Buddhism was able to
        complete the religious picture for most people. As a consequence, both religions
        co-existed, many people practised both, and even temples of both faiths existed
        together on the same site. Many Buddhist deities and figures from Indian <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/mythology/">mythology</span> were readily
        incorporated into the already vast Shinto <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Pantheon/">pantheon</span>. At the
        same time
        Shinto gods acquired Buddhist names (Ryobu Shinto) so that, for example, the sun
        goddess <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Amaterasu/">Amaterasu</span> was
        considered an avatar of Dainichi; and <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Hachiman/">Hachiman</span>, the <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/God/">god</span> of <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/war/">war</span> and
        <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/culture/">culture</span>, was
        the avatar of the Amida Buddha.

    <p>
        Even artworks of one <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/religion/">religion</span> appeared in the
        buildings of the other and priests frequently administered the temples or
        shrines of their counterpart religion. An imperial edict in 764 CE did
        officially place Buddhism above Shinto, but for the majority of the ordinary
        population, the opposite was probably true. One area where Buddhism almost
        completely replaced older beliefs was in death rituals as the Buddhist practice
        of cremation was widely adopted by all levels of society.
    </p>
    <h3>Buddhism &amp; Wider Society</h3>
    <p>
        Buddhist monasteries were frequently given free land and an exemption from tax by
        emperors eager to have a blessing on their reign, and this resulted in them
        becoming both economically powerful and politically influential. Monasteries
        were able to pay for their own armed attendants, a necessary precaution in
        turbulent times when warlords and bandits frequently caused havoc far from the
        imperial capital and, more importantly, a useful source of muscle to bend local
        officials to their way of thinking. The monasteries became so powerful that <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Emperor_Kammu/">Emperor Kammu</span> (r.
        781-806 CE) had even moved the capital from Nara in 784 CE to get away from the
        Buddhist temples around the <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/city/">city</span>. This did not stop the
        monasteries, especially <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Kofukuji/">Kofukuji</span>, Todaiji, <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Enryakuji/">Enryakuji</span>, and Onjoji
        from using force many times throughout the 10th and 11th centuries CE to expand
        their domains and gain favourable conditions from local governors and
        administrators. Rivalries, inevitably, grew up between monasteries, notably
        between <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/To-ji/">To-ji</span> and Kyosan.
    </p>
    <p>
        On a more peaceful note, monasteries were an important part of the local
        community, providing schools and facilities for higher studies, libraries, and
        food and shelter to the needy. Monks also helped in communal projects such as
        road, bridge, and irrigation building - even if this sometimes irked the
        imperial court when the monks received large donations from a grateful public
        and caused some emperors to ban monks from leaving their monasteries.

    <h3>Important Buddhist Figures</h3>
    <p>
        Buddhism continued to evolve as a faith in both <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/india/">India</span> and China
        with new
        sects developing, which eventually made their way to Japan via monks who studied
        abroad. The first six important sects in Japan were the Kusha, Sanron, Ritsu,
        Jojitsu, Kegon, and Hosso. Two of the most noted scholar monks were <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Kukai/">Kukai</span> (774-835 CE) and <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Saicho/">Saicho</span> (767-822 CE), who
        founded two more sects, the Shingon and Tendai respectively, both of which
        belong to the Mahayana (Great Vehicle) branch of Buddhism.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Kukai &amp; Shingon Buddhism</strong></p>
    <p>
        Kukai studied in China between 804 and 806 CE and became an advocate of <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Esoteric_Buddhism/">esoteric Buddhism</span>
        or <em>mikkyo</em> which meant that only the initiated, only those who gave up
        their worldly life and resided in a monastery could know the Buddha and so
        achieve enlightenment. The Shingon (or 'True Word') Sect which Kukai studied in
        China (there known as Quen-yen) held that Buddhist teachings came from the
        cosmic Buddha Mahavairocana (Dainichi to the Japanese). Kukai brought these
        ideas to Japan and wrote such works as the <em>Shorai Mokuroku</em> ('A Memorial
        Presenting a List of Newly Imported Sutras'). Crucially, Shingon Buddhism
        proposed that an individual could achieve enlightenment in their own lifetime
        and need not wait for death. Rituals included meditation carried out while the
        body was held in various postures, sacred hand gestures (<em>mudras</em>), and
        the repetition of secret formulas or mantras. Great importance was given to the
        power of prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 819 CE the monk created a centre for his esoteric doctrine on <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Mount_Koya/">Mount Koya</span> (in the
        modern Wakayama Prefecture). Here educated devotees could reach enlightenment
        not by the lifelong study of sutras but by viewing mandalas, the stylised visual
        representation of the teachings of Buddha. In 823 CE Emperor <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Saga/">Saga</span> (r. 809-823 CE) granted
        the founding of the <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/To-ji/">Toji</span>
        ('Eastern') temple at Minami-ku in Kyoto thus indicating that Shingon Buddhism
        had become an accepted part of the official state religion. In 921 CE, almost a
        century after his death, Kukai was given the posthumous title of Kobo Daishi,
        meaning 'Great Teacher of Spreading the Law', by the emperor.

    <p><strong>Saicho &amp; Tendai Buddhism</strong></p>
    <p>
        Saicho was a monk who decided to live as an ascetic hermit on the slopes of Mount
        Hiei near Kyoto, and in 788 CE, he built the first shrine of what would later
        become the huge Enryaku-ji temple complex and centre of learning. He began to
        study all he could on every variation of Buddhism and to attract followers,
        including two of his best-known disciples - Ensho and Gishin. Saicho then
        visited <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Tang_Dynasty/">Tang</span> China in
        804 CE, where he studied four branches of Buddhism including Zen and Tiantai. He
        was initiated into the higher levels of the faith, studied texts of Mikkyo
        (Esoteric Buddhism), and brought back with him over 200 manuscripts and various
        implements for use in esoteric rituals.

        Saicho sought to simplify the teachings of Buddhism, and on his return, he
        founded the eclectic Tendai Sect (<em>Tendaishu</em>) which taught that the best
        and quickest way to reach enlightenment was through esoteric ritual, that is
        rites which only the priesthood and initiated had access to. At the same time,
        it allowed for many different ways to reach enlightenment. The Tendai branch of
        Buddhism was eventually given royal approval by Kammu, and Saicho performed the
        first esoteric rites in Japan to receive official sponsorship in 805 CE. On his
        death in 822 CE, Saicho, given the honorary title Dengyo Daishi, was also
        considered a bodhisattva, that is, one who has reached nirvana but remains on
        earth to guide others.

        Tendai, perhaps inevitably given its broad range of eclectic beliefs, would, over
        the centuries, spawn other important Buddhist offshoots such as those of the
        Pure Land (Jodo) with the immensely popular figure of Amida, the universal
        Buddha, at its head, which was founded by the monk Honen (1133-1212 CE) and the
        Nichiren sect. Into the medieval period, more sects would come along, especially
        related to Zen Buddhism, and the faith would continue to be widely practised
        right up to the 15th century CE (when Shinto made something of a comeback) and,
        of course, it continues today to be a popular religion in modern-day Japan.
