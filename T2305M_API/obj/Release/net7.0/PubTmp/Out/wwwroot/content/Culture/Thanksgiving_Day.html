    <p>
        The United States holiday of Thanksgiving is generally understood to be inspired
        by the harvest feast celebrated by the citizens of <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Plymouth_Colony/">Plymouth Colony</span>
        (later known as pilgrims) and the Native Americans of the <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Wampanoag_Confederacy/">
            Wampanoag
            Confederacy
        </span> in the fall of 1621.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although there is evidence of earlier thanksgiving celebrations in the Americas
        by the Spanish in the 16th century and at the <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Jamestown_Colony_of_Virginia/">
            Jamestown
            Colony of Virginia
        </span> in 1610, following what is known as the “starving
        times” of 1609, these are not recognized as the “First Thanksgiving”, a term
        coined by the editor <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/Alexander/">Alexander</span>
        Young in 1841 referring specifically to the account of the 1621 event as given
        by the Plymouth Colony's chroniclers <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/William_Bradford/">William Bradford</span>
        (l. 1590-1657) and <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Edward_Winslow/">

        Once the Plymouth Colony had successfully established itself, after struggling
        through their first year, <em>Mourt's Relation</em> was carried back to <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/england/">England</span> and
        published by <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Robert_Cushman/">
            Robert
            Cushman
        </span> (l. 1577-1625) who had negotiated the <em>
            <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Mayflower/">Mayflower</span>
        </em>
        voyage. The book seems to have been an initial success before going out of print
        and was only brought back to public notice in 1841. Bradford's work, <em>
            Of
            Plymouth Plantation
        </em>, which also references the 1621 event, was
        published in 1856 and the popular poem, <em>The Courtship of Miles Standish</em>
        by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (l. 1807-1882) came out in 1858 all further
        popularizing the story of the pilgrims.

        The modern celebration of the holiday was formalized across
        the United States only in 1963 CE, although it had been observed regionally for
        100 years prior.
    </div>
    <p>
        Sarah Josepha Hale (l. 1788-1879), the writer and editor of the popular
        periodical <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em> (published 1830-1878), campaigned for
        the national observance of Thanksgiving Day beginning in 1846. She wrote to each
        sitting president advocating the adoption of the holiday, but it was only acted
        upon in 1863 by President <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Abraham,_the_Patriarch/">Abraham</span>
        Lincoln (served 1861-1865) during the American Civil <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/war/">War</span> (1861-1865) as a means of
        encouraging national unity.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is thought, however, that his decision was influenced by the popularity of the
        pilgrims' story through the above publications in concert with Hale's advocacy.
        The modern celebration of the holiday was formalized across the United States
        only as recently as 1963 under President John F. Kennedy (served 1961-1963),
        although it had been observed regionally for 100 years prior.
    </p>
    <p>
        Presently, it is one of the most popular celebrations in the United States most
        often observed by gatherings of friends, family, a large meal, and participating
        in or watching American football games; the pilgrims and their <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Native_Peoples_of_North_America/">
            Native
            American
        </span> guests serving mainly as backdrops and decorations for the
        event, but this version of the observance is fairly recent and often ignores the
        realities of the historical event which inspired it.
    </p>
    <h3>Plymouth Colony &amp; First Thanksgiving</h3>
    <p>
        The Plymouth Colony was founded by a group comprised of <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Puritans/">Puritan</span> separatists (the
        pilgrims) and Anglican settlers who had been hired or invited to join them by
        the merchant adventurer Thomas Weston (l. 1584 - c. 1647) who secured them a
        patent from the Virginia Company of London and rented them the
        <em>Mayflower</em> to establish a profitable colony in Virginia. The
        <em>Mayflower</em> was blown off course, however, and landed in New England, far
        from the already established colony of <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Jamestown_Colony_of_Virginia/">Jamestown</span>,
        which they had thought they could count on for assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dropping anchor off the coast of Cape Cod on 11 November 1620, the 102 passengers
        of the <em>Mayflower</em> understood they were on their own, winter had already
        begun, they were short on supplies, and had arrived too late to plant any crops.
        They survived by stealing caches of corn from the Native Americans, raiding
        graves where food was left as offering, and hunting expeditions but, even so,
        between December of 1620 and March of 1621, 50% of the passengers and crew would
        die of malnutrition and various diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
        They were saved in March 1621 when the Native American <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Samoset/">Samoset</span> (also given as
        Somerset, l. c. 1590-1653) walked boldly into the settlement, welcomed them in
        English, and introduced them to Tisquantum (better known as <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Squanto/">Squanto</span>, l. c. 1585-1622,
        who also spoke English) and the chief of the Wampanoag Confederacy Ousamequin
        (better known by his title, <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Massasoit/">Massasoit</span>, l. c.
        1581-1661). Massasoit ordered Squanto to remain with the pilgrims and teach them
        how to survive.

    <p>
        By the fall of 1621, with Squanto's help, the colonists were able to bring in a
        good crop and had been shown the best hunting grounds and fishing streams. The
        colonists decided to celebrate with a harvest feast which has since been defined
        as the First Thanksgiving. The narrative of the event is usually given along the
        lines provided by the scholar George F. Willison in his 1945 book, <em>
            Saints
            and Strangers: Being the Lives of the Pilgrim Fathers &amp; Their Families,
            with Their Friends and Foes,
        </em> which is loosely based on Bradford's and
        Winslow's earlier account:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            As the day of the harvest festival approached, four men were sent out to
            shoot waterfowl, returning with enough to supply the company for a week.
            Massasoit was invited to attend and shortly arrived – with ninety ravenous
            braves! The strain on the larder was somewhat eased when some of these went
            out and bagged five deer. Captain Standish staged a military review, there
            were games of skill and chance, and for three days the Pilgrims and their
            guests gorged themselves on venison, roast duck, roast goose, clams and
            other shellfish, succulent eels, white bread, corn bread, leeks and
            watercress and other “sallet herbes”, with wild plums and dried berries as
            dessert – all washed down with wine, made of the wild grape, both white and
            red, which the Pilgrims praised as “very sweete and strong”. At this first
            Thanksgiving feast in New England, the company may have enjoyed, though
            there is no mention of it in the record, some of the long-legged “Turkies”
            whose speed of foot in the woods constantly amazed the Pilgrims. (189)
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The story of the First Thanksgiving comes from only two sources initially:
        Bradford and Winslow's <em>Mourt's Relation,</em> which gives a detailed
        account, and Bradford's <em>Of Plymouth Plantation,</em> which references the
        event in more general terms. Bradford writes:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            They began now [fall of 1621) to gather in the small harvest they had, and to
            prepare their houses for the winter, being well recovered and in health and
            strength and plentifully provisioned; for while some had been thus employed
            in affairs away from home, others were occupied in fishing for cod, bass,
            and other fish, of which they caught a good quantity, every family having
            their portion. All summer there was no want. And now, as winter approached,
            wild fowl began to arrive [and] they got abundance of wild turkeys besides
            venison. (Book II. ch. 2)
        </p>
        <p>
            Harvest time had now come, and then instead of famine, <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/God/">God</span> gave them plenty, and
            the face of things was changed, to the rejoicing of the hearts of many for
            which they blessed God. And the effect of their particular planting was well
            seen, for all had, one way or another, pretty well to bring the year about,
            and some of the abler sort and more industrious had to spare, and sell to
            others, in fact, no general want or famine has been amongst them since, to
            this day. (Book II. ch. 4)

    <p>
        Some versions of Bradford's work insert the line, “they set apart a day of
        thanksgiving” in place of, or after, “for which they blessed God” but this seems
        a later addition by an editor. The first version of the event, from <em>
            Mourt's
            Relation
        </em>, makes no mention of establishing a holiday for giving thanks:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            Our harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men on fowling, that so
            we might after a special manner rejoice together after we had gathered the
            fruit of our labors. They four in one day killed as much fowl as, with a
            little help beside, served the company almost a week. At which time, amongst
            other recreations, we exercised our arms, many of the Indians coming amongst
            us, and among the rest their greatest king, Massasoit, with some ninety men,
            whom for three days we entertained and feasted, and they went out and killed
            five deer, which they brought to the plantation and bestowed on our
            governor, and upon the captain [<span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Myles_Standish/">Myles Standish</span>]
            and others. (82)
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Bradford mentions turkeys, which most likely were served as part of the feast,
        but no menu such as provided by Willison appears in the primary documents and,
        although cranberries probably grew in the nearby wetlands, nothing suggests they
        were harvested. Further, since the settlement had no ovens, butter, or wheat for
        crusts, there were no pies, pumpkin or otherwise. The most glaring
        misrepresentation of the First Thanksgiving story, however, which routinely
        adheres to the above passage from Willison, is that the Native Americans of the
        Wampanoag were invited to the feast; neither of the primary documents suggests
        this in any way.
    </p>
    <p>
        In March of 1621, the first governor of the colony, <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/John_Carver/">John Carver</span> (l.
        1584-1621) signed a peace treaty with Massasoit promising, among other
        stipulations, mutual aid in defense. Bradford and Winslow, in <em>
            Mourt's
            Relation,
        </em> mention the colonists firing their weapons (“we exercised our
        arms”) just before Massasoit and his warriors arrive and so it is more likely
        that they came in response to the sound of the muskets in accordance with the
        terms of the treaty.

    <h3>Native American View</h3>
    <div class="big_quote">
        The colonists of the 17th century CE declared many days of
        thanksgiving before &amp; after attacks on Native American villages.
    </div>
    <p>
        A second harvest festival is mentioned by Bradford (given above in Book II. ch. 4
        from <em>Of Plymouth Plantation</em>) as taking place in 1623 but no mention is
        made of any other. <em>Mourt's Relation</em>, and another of Winslow's works,
        <em>Good News from New England</em> (published 1624), helped encourage the
        migration of more English to North America. Between 1630-1636, over 20,000
        English colonists arrived in what has come to be known as the Great Migration.
        The treaty signed between Carver and Massasoit in 1621 was honored from 1621
        until after Massasoit's <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/Death/">death</span> in 1661,
        but those drawn up between colonists and Native Americans afterwards were not.
        Native Americans were either driven from their lands or sold land to the
        colonists – willingly or not – and then moved further inland.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rampant <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/colonization/">colonization</span>
        of New England and continual land grabs finally resulted in the <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Pequot_War/">Pequot War</span> of 1636-1638
        when the Pequot tribe resisted colonization and the destruction of their
        heritage. The Pequots were defeated, many of them killed in <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/battle/">battle</span> or
        murdered afterwards, and survivors sold into slavery. The colonists of the
        Massachusetts Bay Company, not the Plymouth Colony, decreed a day of
        thanksgiving for their victory which is often interpreted by modern-day Native
        Americans as the basis for the Thanksgiving holiday which many observe as a Day
        of Mourning and reflection. Scholar Yvonne Wakim Dennis <em>et al</em>. sum up
        the Native American view:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            National Thanksgiving Day observances are largely filled with myths and
            misinformation. Popular American folklore suggests the “first Thanksgiving”
            was an idyllic feast. This myth, which ignores the fact that the feast was
            never repeated and that Thanksgiving is an invented holiday, runs contrary
            to many realities. The tale ignores the Pilgrims, who plundered a Native
            person's store of corn for the winter and opened some graves; ignores the
            Wampanoag, who brought most of the food; ignores the Pilgrims who viewed the
            Wampanoag as heathens and savages; and ignores the Pilgrims who did not even
            call the three-day event “Thanksgiving”. Thanksgiving observances omit the
            fact that virtually all Native nations have ritual ceremonies of giving
            thanks to the Creator, ceremonies established long before the “Thanksgiving”
            in 1621 took place. (58)

        New England colonists of the time, and later immigrant writers, had little
        interest in Native American <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/culture/">culture</span> or
        in narratives which challenged their own and so the details from Bradford's and
        Winslow's account were modified and Native American views ignored. The colonists
        of the 17th century declared many days of thanksgiving before and after attacks
        on Native American villages, especially during <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/King_Philip&#39;s_War/">
            King Philip's
            War
        </span> (1675-1678), and this is often cited in the present day by Native
        American tribes as a reason to observe Thanksgiving through mourning rather than
        celebration. Prior to the 19th century, the descendants of the early colonists
        themselves seem to have observed the holiday in various forms as well.

    <h3>Development &amp; Modern Celebration</h3>
    <p>
        <em>Mourt's Relation</em> and <em>Of Plymouth Plantation</em> only became
        available to the general public in 1841 and 1856, respectively, and so played no
        part in the First National Proclamation of Thanksgiving in 1777 which had
        nothing to do with the 1621 event and was intended as a solemn day of worship
        and praise of God. It was set for Thursday, the 18th of December 1777 and
        followed the model of the Puritan Day of Humiliation in which people would fast,
        pray for forgiveness of sins, and abstain from labor and recreation. This
        Thanksgiving observance would be unrecognizable to most Americans celebrating
        the holiday in the present era.
    </p>
    <p>
        The popularity of the pilgrim narrative, as given by Bradford and Winslow and
        then developed by Longfellow and others, had developed a significant hold on the
        collective American imagination by the mid-19th century, which is why Sarah
        Josepha Hale's suggestion to President Lincoln was taken more seriously than her
        previous attempts to have Thanksgiving recognized nationally.

        Hale was one of the most popular writers of her day, also responsible for
        advocating abolition, <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/disambiguation/women/">women</span>'s
        rights, elevating the status of cats from utilitarian pest control to pampered
        pets, and encouraging the tradition of trimming a tree as central to the
        celebration of Christmas. It seems clear that a woman of her fame and influence
        would have succeeded earlier in her advocacy for Thanksgiving if the presidents
        she wrote to had been more receptive to her claims; this was only possible,
        however, after the American public had embraced the story of the pilgrims and
        the 1621 event as a foundational myth.

    <p>
        Even after Lincoln's 1863 proclamation designating the 4th Thursday of November a
        national holiday, Thanksgiving was not celebrated in every state of the Union,
        certainly not in southern states, and though it was widely observed, the holiday
        received little blanket support from the U.S. government until the
        administration of John F. Kennedy in 1963 during a period of social unrest and
        conflict, similar in some respects to Lincoln's time. Like Lincoln's decree,
        Kennedy's proclamation was an effort at encouraging unity and mutual
        understanding among Americans.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Although the 1621 event is cited as the inspiration for the Thanksgiving holiday
        in the modern era, thanksgiving celebrations, up through and including Kennedy's
        proclamation, have been encouraged and observed in the United States for reasons
        having little to do with the accounts in the primary documents. In the 17th
        century, thanksgiving days were decreed to give thanks to God either in advance
        of or after a military action against Native Americans, in the 18th century, it
        was decreed by Congress for the same reason, only now in hopes of victory over
        the British, in the 19th century, it was an attempt to encourage unity during a
        time of civil war, and in the 20th, it sought to serve the same purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        To the Native Americans, however, who had their land, language, and culture
        systematically taken from them, Thanksgiving has nothing to do with unity and is
        understood as celebrating the English <span href="https://www.worldhistory.org/warfare/">conquest</span> and outright theft
        of lands they had occupied for thousands of years. Native Americans in the
        present day, whether through public displays or private rituals, observe the day
        quite differently from the descendants of the immigrants who arrived in North
        America in the 17th century.
    </p>
    <p>
        For many Americans, the holiday is now defined by a large feast among family and
        friends and some form of participation in sporting events. To others, or the
        same, Thanksgiving in the present is little more than the starting gun of the
        holiday shopping season, and the pilgrims and Native Americans of the First
        Thanksgiving serve only as decoration around the table and in shop windows.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1621, however, no matter the motivation for succeeding observances, for three
        days the English colonists and their Native American neighbors – who did not
        even share the same language – are reported to have enjoyed each other's company
        over food and drink. Even if later incarnations of the holiday draw on invented
        aspects of the event, and no matter how cynical the observance may seem to many
        in the present, that initial event and the promise it symbolized is still worth
        celebrating as something to aspire to: as a time of genuine communion between
        people of different cultures, values, and goals, who, for a very brief period,
        and before it was betrayed, found a way to live together in peace.
